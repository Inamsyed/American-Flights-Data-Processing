# American-Flights-Data-Processing
Created an Interactive Graphical User Interface that allows user to get specific details about American Flights. This interactive project gives user the ability to search for specific flights of their own choice and do some research . Not only that ,  it also represents certain key details using interactive visuals in the form of graphs and charts etc . This was accomplished and coded using processing . Processing is an open-source , java based low level animation and GUI library built on Java with additional simplifications like additional classes, aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a GUI for simple compilation of the programs written in processing
